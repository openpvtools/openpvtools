Open Source Tools for PV Modeling
=================================

Solar power researchers and engineers are developing a growing number of open source software tools for energy modeling. This website aims to catalog these tools.

Please see the companion paper in the Proceedings of the WCPEC-7 (2018).

Also see the companion presentation at the `10th PVPMC Workshop and 2018 Systems Symposium <https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/resources-and-events/events/2018-10th-pv-performance-modeling-workshop/>`_, plus additional talks on open source PV software from DOE, NREL, and Sandia.

We welcome your contributions to this archive! To contribute or update information on a tool, please submit a pull request to the `openpvtools GitHub repository <https://github.com/openpvtools/openpvtools>`_.
